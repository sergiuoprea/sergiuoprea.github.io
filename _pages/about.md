Hi! I am Sergiu Oprea, a Ph.D. student at University of Alicante under the direction of Prof. [Jose Garcia-Rodriguez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=GNTkqaYAAAAJ&hl=es){:target='\_blank'} and [Sergio Orts-Escolano](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=dznX1DMAAAAJ&hl=es){:target='\_blank'}.

I am working on pushing the boundaries of future video frame prediction using deep-learning based techniques, especially generative adversarial networks.

Please feel free to contact me through [:email:](mailto:soprea@dtic.ua.es){:target='\_blank'} if you have any questions.
